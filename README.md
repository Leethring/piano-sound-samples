# piano_88_key_sound_sample

A collection of piano 88 key sound sample with its related staff and keyboard.

For piano learning and memory, I collect all piano sound sample. This repository is for someone who find hiself (or herself) lacking of music sensitivity, always relies on the piano staff, and plays keyboard with staff not music&mdash;em...I mean myself, hahaha.

If you like me want to improve your piano listening skill and want to link the sound to the key or the stall, this repository is for. Also, if you just need these sound databases, you can directly downloads them.
